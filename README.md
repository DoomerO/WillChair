# WillChair
<p>This is the final project of our technician course of informatics for the internet. We are studying at ETE Amaury Cesar Viera, a branch of the larger FAETEC (Fundação de Apoio à Escola Técnica; in english: Technician School Support Foundation). This is a government owned instution from the state of Rio de Janeiro for education, initiation into the labor market and technical knowledge.</p>
<p>We named our project "Willchair", because our objective is creating an application to facilitate the access of mobility aids and equipment. The main idea is to connect equipment owners to whoever needs them.</p>
<p>We are using React for the front-end of our application and mysql for the back-end, for the database and server, knex and express.</p>
